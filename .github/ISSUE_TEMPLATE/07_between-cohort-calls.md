This is the same for all Calls except the first. Create one issue for each Cohort Call, e.g. 2 to 5, and add the Call number to the issue title. Final Cohort Call has additional tasks in Prepare final Cohort Call template.

Described in [Approach Guide: Between Cohort Calls](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/champions/leading-cohort-calls.html#between-cohort-calls). 

- [ ] Write Field Notes in post-call DebriefDigests doc
- [ ] Upload recording to Cohort Folder
- [ ] Write and post Digest as a GitHub issue and tag cohort GitHub team like `@2022-noaa-sefsc-summer-cohort`. 
    - Send Mon or Tues in the week after the Cohort Call rather than immediately after, so people have touchpoint in the week between Calls.
- [ ] Prepare Coworking Doc
